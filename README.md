# Champ Select Assistance
Summary: A Python program for champion selection for the game League of Legends.

### Program Info

**Python version**: 3.9.8, **Packages used**: pygame, pygame_gui, requests



Using Pygame and the [LCU](https://riot-api-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lcu.html), this program will look into your Champion Select in League of Legends and analyze the winrates using data live from the [Lolalytics website](https://lolalytics.com/). This program works across both ARAM and Summoner's Rift and includes links to champion statistics websites based on the selected champions ([U.GG](https://u.gg), [Lolalytics](https://lolalytics.com), and [League of Graphs](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/)).

### Why Make This?

When determining what character I'd like to play in the popular game, I would always lean towards the more statistically superior champions. As not all champions are the same, they differ on their average win percentage. Compared to another champion, a higher win percentage means that there is a higher chance that the champion with the higher winrate wins.

I found myself looking up the winrates manually each time that I wanted to pick a champion. This consumed a lot of time, so I decided to automate the process as well as experiment with a GUI in Python. 

### Examples

Here is an example of my program found next to the live League of Legends Champion Select:
